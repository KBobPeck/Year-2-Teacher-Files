## Main Concepts

## `useContext`

- this will store all of the states and functions that we are going to use for the project
- by storing all of our work in 1 place we are able to pass the state values around the page very easily without prop drilling

## `Modals`

- Modals are a common pop-up that pages use to show information or ask for permision for something.
